## NINA Log Analyzer

fdesvallees@mailbox.org

Based on [Brian Carter's program](https://bcarter2490.shinyapps.io/NINALogAnalyzer/).

Displays details from your NINA astrophotography log.   
The upper frame has a time chart with most events in the log.   
The lower frame has the log itself.   

Zoom and pan on the chart to see detail, click to set a cursor that indicates the start of the log.

Scroll in the log frame. Both frames are synchronized.

There Ishen Obolbekov was waiting for us. Together with his wife Gulmira and his brother Rash, Ishen runs Shepherd’s way Trekking, a company that organizes horse treks in several mountain ranges throughout the country.\nGetting there We first drove from Bishkek to Naryn, where we spent the night in the guest house run by Celestial Mountains Tours, then to Tash Rabat, one of the best-preserved caravanserails from the Silk Road. In Tash Rabat we met our guides Toko and Esen, who had brought the horses by truck. After a few quick instructions on how to handle the horses (“tchi” to advance, “brrr” to stop) we were off to our first pass, 4000 meters high but not too hard, that led us to the southern side of Ak-Say range.\nDays 1-7 - Ak-Say Ak-Say is a range that runs from southwest to northeast near the Chinese border. Its northern side is drained by the Naryn river (the former Syr Darya), and the rivers on the southern side feed the Kakshaal river that flows into China. For a whole week we rode towards the north east, always above 3000 meters. Every day we met shepherds and marmot trappers from At Bashi, on the northern side of the range. Most spend only the summer on the south side, but some stay for the winter, a very cold prospect indeed. Wolves are just about the only distractions you can expect.\nDays 8-9 - The Ulan river After crossing the strategic road that leads to Chatir Kul lake (our only camp below 3000 meters), we started going up along the river Ulan. For one day we rode on the northern side of a long canyon of red earth, along a narrow trail several hundred meters above the river. I did not take pictures that day, for fear of losing the horse’s reins. The next day, after an easy pass at 4000 meters we descended the northern Ulan river, inside a narrow canyon of red mud where we had to dismount, and arrived at a lodge run by a hunting company. There are quite a few of these operators in Kyrgyzstan, who charge several thousand dollars for the right to kill endangered Marco Polo sheep.\nDays 10-11 - Up the Karakolka After a long afternoon up the Naryn river’s flat bed, we arrived at our planned meeting with Rash, who was bringing supplies for the rest of the trek. It was quite a logistical achievement for a party of horses to meet a truck exactly at the right time after 10 days, with no communications whatsoever. (Cell phone coverage is limited to the cities). The next day we started the trek up the Karakolka river, crossing it several times. This is where the skills of the horseman count : You cannot cross these fast-flowing rivers on foot, but horses can cross up to a depth of about one meter.\nDays 12-13 - The Chakyr Korum pass We camped at a site with a breathtaking view, just below a steep natural dam of white gravel. Toko announced with a big smile that we would be riding up this dam. Indeed the next day we started on foot, and entered a canyon of white rock, lined with vertical red cliffs. The canyon itself is impassable for horses, so we had another steep climb out of it, and arrived on the high plateau on the north side. After yet another long descent we camped on the bed of the Chakyr Korum river. The next day we climbed our last pass (Kara-Suu) at 4000 meters, and finally got to Kara Sai, where Rash was waiting for us with the truck. We had the good surprise to find a hot hammam in the hunter’s lodge.\n####Day 14 - The Ak Shirak canyon\nWe spent one day to travel by minibus to a spectacular canyon not far from the Chinese border. By that time the weather had changed and we did this under a snowstorm. We got back to Barskoon under a full moon up the “pass of Bones” at 4000 meters.\nBarskoon, Karakol and return Barskoon, by lake Issyk Kul at 1700 meters, was a welcome rest. We spent one day in nearby Karakol, a pleasant town with a fine museum commemorating general Przhevalsky, a 19th Russian explorer who lead several expeditions in eastern Siberia and China.\nWe had spent 14 days on horseback, riding 5 to 6 hours daily, and covered at least 300 kilometers. Even though this was my first time on a horse, I felt fine when arriving. The horses are very sure-footed, and the saddles (made of wood, but covered with a thick sheep skin) are quite comfortable.\nOverall this was a great experience, and I look forward to return to Kyrgyzstan, though perhaps for a shorter trek this time."},"title":"Horse Trek in Kyrgyzstan"},"/fr/archive/la-fin-la-caravane-est-passee/":{"data":{"":"Je retransmets le message de Jean-Noël Fessy:\nC’est fini, quatre jours de vents violents des tempêtes d’équinoxe suivis des premières neiges ont eu raison de l’installation, ils l’ont couchée à quelques exceptions près.

This shows how to upgrade it with a modern TeenAstro controller in a reversible way, without modifying any of the connectors. The original Temma2 electronics box is removed and replaced by a custom box.\nIt has a classical gear arrangement. Both RA and DEC axes have the same motor (NEMA17, 200 steps/rev), reducer (18:1) and gears (60:24). The RA axis wheel has 240 teeth, and the DEC has 144 teeth. The resulting gear ratios are:\nRA: 18 x 2.5 x 240 = 10800\nDEC: 18 x 2.5 x 144 = 6480\nThe encoders on the worm are ABN type with 300 pulses/rev. At sidereal speed, on the RA axis, we get one A/B pulse every 0.8333 second and one N pulse every 250 seconds.\nAt this time, I use a temporary aluminium plate with an external TeenAstro. Eventually it will be replaced by a small TeenAstro board attached to the mount.\nI made simple 4-wire adapters to plug the motors. The Temma2 has Rose connectors that are mechanically very close to similar Molex models. The encoders connectors have 6 pins at 1.27mm pitch. It is difficult, but possible to make an adapter to the easier 2.54mm pitch. However I have not yet figured out how Takahashi uses them. Of course they are not absolute, so they cannot be used like modern 10-Micron or Astrophysics mounts, but they might be used to improve tracking (more on this later).\nThe mount works fine. The original Temma2 electronics are rated to 350x. I set the maximum slewing speed to 420x, with 16 microsteps (no need to use a bigger value with such a high gear). In Motion Controller mode (SPI only), it would be possible to run faster, but this would push the motors way beyond their rated maximum speed."},"title":"Takahashi NJP"},"/fr/astronomy/njp2/":{"data":{"":"body:\nI finished adapting a TeenAstro Main Unit version 2.5.4 to the NJP mount, with a custom wooden box."},"title":"Takahashi NJP (Integrated TeenAstro)"},"/fr/astronomy/north_am_pelican/":{"data":{"":"\nNorth America Nebula and Pelican in the constellation Cygnus Nikkor 180mm@F4, ASI533MC, 42x300sec\nUV/IR Filter\nMount: Astro-Physics 600 with TeenAstro\nPixInsight, Starnet2\nCapture date: 29 Aug 2024"},"title":"North America Nebula"},"/fr/astronomy/rosette_nebula/":{"data":{"":"\n19 Mars 2020\n6x300s - Nikon D750 - Borg 90FL / F4 - Monture AP600 avec contrôleur TeenAstro - Pas de filtre"},"title":"NGC 2244 - Nébuleuse Rosette"},"/fr/astronomy/sadr_region/":{"data":{"":"\nSadr Region: H II region in the constellation Cygnus Nikkor 180mm@F4, ASI533MC, 42x300sec\nUV/IR Filter\nMount: Astro-Physics 600 with TeenAstro\nPixInsight, Starnet2\nCapture date: 27/28 Jul 2024"},"title":"Sadr Region"},"/fr/astronomy/scope_enhancements/":{"data":{"":"\nNouveau chercheur (MiniBorg 50mm)\nTiroir à filtres - position ouverte\nTiroir à filtres - filtre en place"},"title":"Nouveaux accessoires pour mon Dobson Factory 300mm"},"/fr/astronomy/teenastro/":{"data":{"":"I made a new TeenAstro PCB to fix directly on the mount.

My little 37cc Husqvarna was not up to the task so I upgraded to a powerful Stihl MS361. I was lucky to get permission to cut a big cherry tree (almost 60cm diameter at the base) that was dying. It is 30 minutes away from the nearest road, so I carried the gear on my back. Also, the terrain is quite steep, and treacherous to work on. After I felled the tree, and started bucking the trunk, the biggest log rolled down 10 meters into a small ravine.\nSo I had to get a GripHoist to pull it out. That must have been close to 300kg, the specified limit.\nNote the pink sealing paint on the end grain, to reduce checking.

A long time ago I bought simple cheap power tools: a router, electric hand plane and circular saw, and tried making small tables and shelves. I stopped quickly, because my work was shoddy at best, and because I realized I did not want to spend my free time in a noisy and dusty environment. My problem with power tools is that I hate the noise, so I want to finish quickly, and of course I am not careful. Then last year I decided to make a Japanese-style sliding screen (Shoji) so I bought a book by Toshio Odate, and found sites like Dick and Dieter Schmid that sell tools, and started again, this time working mostly by hand.\n####Wood\nThe first difficulty was to find suitable wood. Normally Shoji are made with fine cedar, which the local lumber yards do not have (I live near Nice, in southern France). Of the available woods, pine is too soft and spongy, oak is too brittle, so I settled on cherry. The yards here sell mostly to professionals, and normally sell a whole tree instead of individual boards. I was lucky to find a partially opened log with 3 boards (approx 2.6 meter long by 30cm wide, thickness 50mm) of acceptable quality. They were somewhat warped, but thick enough to get straight rails and stiles.\n####Power Tools\nMy only power tool is a small Ryobi band-saw. It only cuts up to 80mm, not enough for resawing boards, but sufficient for making my rails and stiles.\n####Hand Tools\nI started with a couple of saws (Dozuki and Ryoba, Japanese hand planes and chisels, then marking tools, etc. Together this adds up to a few hundred euros.\n####Work details\nThe most time-consuming and physical part is to get the wood down to size, with square corners. After cutting the boards with the bandsaw, I started with the scrub plane to get all parts reasonably straight, then used my trying plane and kanna to obtain the final sizes.\nMarking is quick, but requires a lot of care, and cutting tenons does too. Mortises are hard! Each one takes me about 15 minutes, and there are 6 per screen. Cutting the kumiko (lattice) is easier, but it all adds up…\n####The finished screen\nI bought the wood in April this year, and I only finished my 3 screens at Christmas, working in the evenings and some week-ends. Looking back, I did not know it would take me this long, but I am happy with the result, and I have learned a whole set of skills. My next challenge for 2006 is a cabinet, maybe copied from this pretty model by the Garakuta Workshop."},"title":"Woodworking - My First Shoji"},"/fr/woodworking/working-on-new-art-deco-desk/":{"data":{"":"\nI have almost finished this desk for a customer, this time in oak.
